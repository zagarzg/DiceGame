                In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
                BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
                The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
                The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
